## Starting Apps for Development

In order to run a component, it is required to run `csw-location-server`. Moreover, even to start the Event Service or Configuration Service,
`csw-location-server` should be running.

A shell script has been provided to make the starting of services more convenient for developers.  This script will start the Location Service,
and then a set of CSW services that a developer may make use of.  All services are started by default, but specific services can be started
using the command line options (see below). 

Assuming that developer has downloaded `csw-apps-<some-version>.zip` from [csw releases](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw/releases)
and unzipped it, there are four folders, as follows, in `csw-apps-<some-version>`

* bin
* lib
* logging_aggregator
* conf

All the shell scripts provided by CSW reside in `bin` folder. The shell script referred in this segment is named as `csw-services.sh`.
Go to the bin folder and type `./csw-services.sh --help`. This will list all possible options applicable for the script.

Environment variables which are needed to start CSW services are documented in @ref[environment variables](../deployment/env-vars.md).

@@@ note { title=Note }

This shell script will start `csw-location-server` as the first step regardless of any options provided. 

@@@

The execution of the script is such that it starts `csw-location-server`, then start all of the CSW services, unless
one or more of the following options are specified.

* `--auth` if provided, starts authentication service.
* `--config` if provided, starts configuration service.
* `--event` if provided, starts event service. 
* `--alarm` if provided, starts alarm service.
* `--database` if provided, starts database service.

@@@ note

While starting the Database Service, make sure that
 
 * The `PGDATA` environment variable is set to the Postgres data directory where Postgres is installed e.g. for mac: "/usr/local/var/postgres" and
 * there is a password set for the valid Postgres user. If not, go to the Postgres shell via `psql` and run `ALTER USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<mypassword>';`.
If there is any problem entering the Postgres shell, go to the `conf` folder -> `database_service` -> `pg_hba.conf` and change `password` to `trust`. Try entering
the Postgres shell again and set the password. Once set successfully, revert `trust` to `password` in `pg_hba.conf` and run the Database Service via `csw-services.sh`.   

@@@

With this, the component code is now ready to connect to the provided services via `csw-services.sh`.   

## Starting Elastic Logging Aggregator for Development

Elastic stack ([Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html),
           [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html),
           [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html) and 
           [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html)) is used to aggregate logs generated from TMT applications (Scala/Java/Python/C++/C) and
CSW services (mentioned in the previous section). For development purposes, [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is used. Hence, make sure that latest
Docker setup is installed and running before starting the Elastic stack. To know more about how Elastic stack works please refer to @ref[Logging Aggregator](logging_aggregator.md).

For the host setup, follow the below given steps:

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime) version **18.09+**
* Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.24.0+**

On distributions which have SELinux enabled out-of-the-box, you will need to either re-context the files or set SELinux
into Permissive mode in order for docker-elk to start properly. For example, on Redhat and CentOS, the following will
apply the proper context:

```console
$ chcon -R system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 docker-elk/
```
To know more about running Docker for Mac please refer to this [link](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/). For Windows, ensure that the
"Shared Drives" feature is enabled for the `C:` drive (Docker for Windows > Settings > Shared Drives).
See [Configuring Docker for Windows Shared Drives](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/stevelasker/configuring-docker-for-windows-volumes) (MSDN Blog).

Assuming that the developer has downloaded `csw-apps-<some-version>.zip` from [csw releases](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw/releases)
and unzipped it, there are four folders, as follows, in `csw-apps-<some-version>`:

* bin
* lib
* logging_aggregator
* conf

Go to `logging_aggreator/dev` and run

* `docker-compose build  --no-cache`
* `docker-compose up  --force-recreate`

This will start Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana in a Docker container. Note that `csw-services.sh` will generate all log files under 
`/tmp/tmt/logs/csw` and Filebeat will watch for them there.

Once, the Docker container is up, open an browser and go to `http://localhost:5601/` to use Kibana. Go to:

* `Management` -> `Kibana` ->  `Index Patterns` and create an index pattern as per the requirement.
* `Discover` -> `Select the index pattern created` and explore

To use a different Elastic Stack version than the one currently available in the repository, simply change the version in `logging_aggreator/dev/.env`
file, and rebuild the stack with:

* `docker-compose build  --no-cache`
* `docker-compose up  --force-recreate`

Always pay attention to the [upgrade instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html)
for each individual component before performing a stack upgrade.
