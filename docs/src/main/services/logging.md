# Logging Service

The Logging Service library provides an advanced logging facility for CSW components and services. 

@@@note

This page explains local logging only. To understand centralized logging facility, refer to @ref:[this page](../commons/logging_aggregator.md).

## Dependencies

To use the Logging Service without using the framework, add this to your `build.sbt` file:

sbt
:   @@@vars
    ```scala
    libraryDependencies += "com.github.tmtsoftware.csw" %% "csw-logging-client" % "$version$"
    ```
    @@@
    
    
## Configuration

These are the relevant default configuration values for logging

logging.conf
:   @@snip [logging.conf](../../../../csw-logging/csw-logging-client/src/main/resources/logging.conf) { #default-logging-conf }

@@@ note { title="IMPORTANT !!!"}

It is required to include `logging.conf` that is shipped with this library in `application.conf` as follows:

```
include "logging.conf"
```
 
Default configuration values can be then overridden in `application.conf`. 

@@@


@@@ note

 * Logs generated by components will be by default stored at `$TMT_LOG_HOME/tmt/logs`. In case $TMT_LOG_HOME is not set as environment variable,
then they will be stored at `/tmp/tmt/logs`. When logs are stored in the /tmp folder, they will not be persisted in case of machine
reboot. Hence, for production, it is recommended to have $TMT_LOG_HOME set as environment variable.

* `csw-logging.appender-config.file.logPath` from `logging.conf` will treated as subdirectory under the base directory ($TMT_LOG_HOME/tmt/logs or
 /tmp/tmt/logs) to store the logs. It can be also overridden in `application.conf` for each component.
 
@@@

Also `logLevel` for each component can be set in application.conf as follows:

```
component-log-levels {
    tcs {
        trombonehcd = debug
        tromboneassembly = error
    }
  }
  
```
@@@ note

Here `trombonehcd` and `tromboneassembly` is the name of component that will be registered with `LocationService`, 
which is the `name` field in the ComponentInfo file (see @ref:[DeployingComponents](../framework/deploying-components.md)). 
By default, all components will log at level specified by `csw-logging.logLevel`. Also, the component specific log levels will be case-insensitive
i.e `TCS.tromboneHcd` and `tcs.trombonehcd` will represent the same component and the one specified later will take preference. 

@@@

The library provides `StdOutAppender` as the default logging appender. To use `FileAppender` or some custom appender along with 
`StdOutAppender`, override the `appenders` property to include multiple appenders in CSV format as follows:
 
```

appenders = ["csw.logging.client.appenders.FileAppender$", "csw.logging.client.appenders.StdOutAppender$"]

```

@@@ note

Make sure to provide full path of the appender since it will be spawned using Java reflection. In the CSW code base, a working example of a custom appender can be found at:
@github[Custom Appender](/csw-logging/csw-logging-client/src/test/scala/csw/logging/client/appenders/CustomAppenderTest.scala)

@@@

For `StdOutAppender`, specify the format of log statements in `csw-logging.stdout` via `csw-logging.stdout.pretty` and `csw-logging.stdout.oneLine`.  

Turning `pretty` **on** or **off** will produce log statements in following format:

pretty=true
:   @@@vars
    ```
    {"@prefix":"my-subsystem.my-component-name",
     "@subsystem":"my-subsystem",
     "@componentName":"my-component-name",
     "@host":"INsaloni.local",
     "@name":"LocationServiceExampleClient",
     "@severity":"INFO",
     "@version":"0.1",
     "actor":
       "akka://csw-examples-locationServiceClient@10.131.23.195:53618/user/$a",
     "class":"csw.location.LocationServiceExampleClient",
     "file":"LocationServiceExampleClientApp.scala",
     "line":149,
     "message":"Result of the find call: None",
     "timestamp":"2017-11-30T10:58:03.102Z"
     }
    ```
    @@@
      
pretty=false
:   @@@vars
    ```
    {"@prefix":"my-subsystem.my-component-name","@subsystem":"my-subsystem","@componentName":"my-component-name","@host":"INsaloni.local","@name":"LocationServiceExampleClient","@severity":"INFO","@version":"0.1","actor":"akka://csw-examples-locationServiceClient@10.131.23.195:53618/user/$a","class":"csw.location.LocationServiceExampleClient","file":"LocationServiceExampleClientApp.scala","line":149,"message":"Result of the find call: None","timestamp":"2017-11-24T04:16:42.108Z"}
    ```
    @@@
    

Similarly, turning `oneLine` on will produce log statements in following format:

oneLine=true
:   @@@vars
    ```
    [INFO] Attempting to find connection (LocationServiceExampleClientApp.scala 131)
    ```
    @@@
  
@@@ note

* If `oneLine` is set to `true` then value of `pretty` will be ignored

## Log Levels

Following Log levels are supported by csw-logging library

* FATAL
* ERROR
* WARN
* INFO
* DEBUG
* TRACE

The library allows separate log levels for the component logging API (logLevel), Akka logging (akkaLogLevel), and Slf4J 
(slf4jLogLevel). The initial values of these are set in the configuration file as seen above. These can be overridden in the application.conf file.

These values can also be changed dynamically by calling methods on `LoggingSystem` class.

## Log Structure
All messages are logged by default as Json. Logs can contain following fields:

* `@prefix`: The combination of @subsystem and @componentName of the component for e.g. `tcs.filter.wheel` 
* `@subsystem`: The name of the subsystem, if present
* `@componentName`: The name of the component, if present
* `@host`: The local host name
* `@name`: The name of the application being run
* `@version`: The version of the application being run
* `@severity`: The message level: trace, debug, info, warn, error or fatal
* `actor`: The path for an actor when using ActorLogging
* `class`: The class for ClassLogging or ActorLogging
* `file`: The file containing the log call
* `kind`: Either slf4j or akka. Not present for logger API
* `line`: The line where the message was logged
* `message`: The log message
* `timestamp`: The UTC time when the message was logged
* `trace`: Information for any exception specified in the logging call


@@@ note

* `@host`, `@name` and `@version` will appear in log statements only if _fullHeaders_ is set as true in the configuration
* `file` and `line` will appear only in log statements from Scala classes/actors.  This is typical for Java logging tools, and is due to the lack of macro support in Java.

## Enable Component Logging
Component developers will have an instance of `LoggerFactory` available from `csw-framework`. This instance will already have a `prefix` set by `csw-framework` which will
appear in log statements in the `@prefix`,`@subsystem` and `@componentName` tags. To get the `Logger` instance from the `LoggerFactory`, use one of the following:  

Scala Class

@@@ note

The `LoggerFactory` can be changed to `JLoggerFactory` by using `asJava` method and `JLoggerFactory` can be changed to `LoggerFactory` by using `asScala` method

## Enable Generic Logging
In case there is a need to log statements without having a `@prefix`, `@subsystem` and `@componentName` tags, which can be due to unavailability of componentName in some utility code, then use the `GenericLoggerFactory`
as follows:

Scala Class

The Logger `log` is now available in Scala and Java classes to write log statements as explained in next section.

## Log Statements

Logging statements are used very much like existing logging services such as log4j.  For Java, there is an additional way of 
writing log messages using Supplier methods (lambdas).  The use of lambdas is more efficient since the computations in a 
message (e.g. string concatenation) are not performed unless the message is actually being logged.  Therefore, these supplier 
methods should be used in cases where high performance is required (see [performance results below](#java-logging-string-vs-supplier-api-performance)).

A basic info statement can be written as follows:

Scala
:   @@snip [LocationServiceExampleClientApp](../../../../examples/src/main/scala/example/location/LocationServiceExampleClientApp.scala) { #log-info }

Java
:   @@snip [JLocationServiceExampleClient](../../../../examples/src/main/java/example/location/JLocationServiceExampleClient.java) { #log-info }

Java (Supplier)
:   @@snip [JLocationServiceExampleClient](../../../../examples/src/main/java/example/location/JLocationServiceExampleClient.java) { #log-info-supplier }

The output of log statement will be:

Scala
:   @@@vars
    ```

## Performance
Performance results documented on this page is measured in terms of throughput and obtained with the JMH Java benchmark harness. 
Sourcecode for all the JMH benchmarks can be found here at @github[CSW Benchmarks](/csw-benchmark/src/main) 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput) definition of "throughput" is the maximum rate of production or the 
maximum rate at which something can be processed. 
In our case, throughput is defined as how many messages can be logged in a certain period of time.

### Scala Logging : Appender's Throughput

![Logging Appenders Throughput](../images/logging-perf/logging-appenders-perf-results-play-json.png)

Above graph includes the throughput results for File and StdOut appenders using the Scala logging API. The Java logging API throughput results are included further down this page.  
As shown in the above graph, the experiment was carried out for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 threads. That means, multiple threads are logging messages concurrently. 

@@@ note

* Numbers indicated in the graph does not mean that those number of messages are actually written to file or console. These are the number of logging messages sent to LogActor asynchronously for the period of one second.
* It is the responsibility of LogActor to write these messages to file or console.
* LogActor uses BoundedMailbox with a mailbox-capacity = 262144, messages are dropped if mailbox gets full.

### Scala And Java Logging : Throughput Comparision (Log Level Enabled vs Disabled)
Below graph depicts the throughput of the Java logging API (String and Supplier) and the Scala logging API when the log level was enabled and disabled. 

@@@ note

* **Log Level Enabled**  : Results are obtained for `log.info` when the default log level was set to `info`, which means the logging messages were sent to LogActor for writing it to file.
* **Log Level Disabled** : Results are obtained for `log.trace` when the default log level was set to `info`, which means the logging messages were not written to file.

![Java Scala Throughput Comparision](../images/logging-perf/java-scala-logging-throughput-comparision-play-json.png)

This graph is produced based on the result generated by @github[JE2ELoggingBenchmark](/csw-benchmark/src/main/java/csw/logging/perf/jmh/JE2ELoggingBenchmark.java) and 
@github[E2ELoggingBenchmark](/csw-benchmark/src/main/scala/csw/logging/perf/jmh/E2ELoggingBenchmark.scala)

@@@ note

* As you can see in the above graph, the Supplier version of the Java log API and the "by name" version of Scala API are 
very efficient and throughput is much higher than the String version.  Therefore, it is recommended that Java developers use the Supplier API.
