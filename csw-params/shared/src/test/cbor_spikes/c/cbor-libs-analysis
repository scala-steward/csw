TinyCbor - Okay library for CBOR in C/C++ language. Very little documentation which is not helpful. No installation
instructions. Compilation requires linking all the source code along with test code. Does correct decoding. Decoding in C++
is not attempted as there is lack of example.

libcbor - Excellent library for CBOR in C language. Very well documented and nice examples. https://github.com/PJK/libcbor
Easy install commands for MacOS and Linux. Does encoding and decoding in short and compact code. This could decode out `input.cbor` file correctly. Not for C++.

cbor-cpp - Okay library for CBOR in CPP language. No documentation and example. Requires building the project and modify
CMakeLists.txt according to your need. This is not a feasible option in most cases. However, the library could decode the
`input.cbor` correctly.

cborg - Good library for CBOR in CPP language. No documentation and examples. No installation instructions. Compilation
requires linking all the source code along with test code. Does correct decoding. Can only parse `const uint8_t*` types.
The API for decoding is straightforward to use.

cbor-lite - Unusable library for CBOR  in CPP language. Depends on Boost. Very less documentation and no examples. Not Easy
to install as it needs to be built using CMakeLists.txt. Could not check decoding.

GoldFish - Okay library for CBOR in CPP languages. No installation instructions. Good examples and some API documentation.
Promises to decode CBOR files from various type of streams(files, vectors, string, binary). Could not be tested.
